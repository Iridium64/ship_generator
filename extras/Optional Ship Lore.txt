The Anvil comes in three sizes, each three times larger than the last, but based on the same basic plans. It is a modular design, such that the attachment points on its hull can be changed out with minimal mess. This means that Anvils come in a variety of mission profiles, for liner hauling, tramp freight, heavy manufacturing, as a supersized yard tug, or even asteroid wildcatting. The main thruster is mounted along the centreline, and the secondary thrusters are mounted in a cross-shape by the rear. An Anvil has two cockpits; one for intersystem travel on the left-hand-side, and one for intrasystem travel on the right-hand-side. They are named Anvils for their strong resemblance to the object.

The Swallow is perhaps the cheapest and smallest independent ship out there. It is incredibly common, and can be refit into a variety of roles depending on the owner's wishes - such as exploration, freight and passengers, and more. Most designs mount two auxilary engines, one on each side, plus the centre-mounted main thruster; some high-speed designs have dual thrusters or four independently-mounted thrusters. The Swallow has a cockpit at the front, engines mounted at the rear, and one mission pod flanking each side. These can be changed out to anything that the Swallow is required to do.

The Skink is a larger Swallow, although it is more expensive and less common than its smaller cousin. Like the Swallow, the Skink can be used for a variety of purposes, yet it sees most of its use in transport and cargo. It mounts a total of six secondary thrusters and a single primary thruster, and each ship contains two powerplants.
